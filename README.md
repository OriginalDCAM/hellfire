# Final Assignment

## Introduction
This is my final assignment for the course "Computer Graphics", where I made an 3D graphics engine/framework using OpenGL.

## Required Packages (Temp will bundle soon with the project)
- Glut in :C/Libraries
- Glew in :C/Libraries
- GLM in :C/Libraries

## Packages bundled with project
- Assimp (Model loading)
- ImGui (GUI)
- stb (Image loading)
- nlohmann (Json parsing)

## Installation Visual Studio
Step 1. Clone the git repository. Make sure to clone the recursively because this project uses git submodules.
Step 2. Right click in the root directory of the project and select open with 'Visual Studio'
Step 3. Run the sandbox project.


## Features
- Basic 3D rendering
- Camera movement
- Basic lighting (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular)
- Model loading (OBJ, GLTF, FBX format)
- Texture loading
- Basic animation
- Scene serialization/deserialization (using JSON)
- Basic GUI using ImGui, get opened using '`' key
- Scene transitions
- Scene management
- Ability to load multiple shaders

## Things I'd like to improve
- Add more advanced lighting models (PBR)
- Add more advanced materials
- Ability to script using a language like lua
- User interface needs improvement
